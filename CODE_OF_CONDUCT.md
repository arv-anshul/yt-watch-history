# Code of Conduct

## Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism.
- Focusing on what is best for the community.
- Showing empathy towards other community members.

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project contributors must adhere to the following guidelines:

- **Setup Environment:**

  - It is mandatory for contributors to set up the development environment as per the provided guidelines in the repository documentation. This ensures consistency in development practices.

- **Install Pre-commit:**

  - Before contributing, contributors must install `pre-commit` by running `make install-hooks` to ensure consistent code formatting and checks.

- **Run Tests (if available):**

  - Contributors should run tests, if available, before submitting changes by following the instructions provided in the repository.

### Enforcement Responsibilities

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainers. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.
